###General:

Ensure footer line height is not an issue while in small resolution

Review NavBar background colour

Fix nav-bar in SM (does not pop correclty)

Change current "Rissalah school, Prayer time and gallery" width to take more space in md and lg screens

Maybe add a section with text to prevent image overload

Improve layout and style of content
    Remove <ul> and <ol>

Improve layout and style of Iqama section

Set max-height of picture (not too sure how to do it for SM and XL screens)

Keep Carousel or change layout to have previews only?
