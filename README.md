Welcome to Nicolas Vandendriessche's User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project!

## Background 

The Cork local mosque website (http://www.corkmosque.com/admin/) is not maintained and difficult to navigate. I chose to redesign the current website to improve UX and accessibility.

The main changes are ensuring the pages remain short with compelling title and add a dedicated section for prayer time (see user stories). The navbar has also been added above the main picture.

## UX

### User Story

As a Muslin in cork, X uses the website mainly to check prayer time.

As a Muslim living with children, Y is interested to see what weekend activities the local masjid can offer.

As a practicing muslim, Z would like to be able to submit ideas to the local masjid through their website.

### Wireframe

Please see wireframe folder.

### UX/Design choice

As per the user story, the main expected reason for people to visit the website is to gather information about the prayer time. For this reason, prayer time is centered in index.html and timetable can be downloade from the footer.

## Technologies used

For this project, we used HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP. In order to have the navbar shrink, Javascript has been used (see credit below).
