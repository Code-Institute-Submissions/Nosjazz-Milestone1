Welcome to Nicolas Vandendriessche's User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project!

The Cork local mosque website (http://www.corkmosque.com/admin/) is not maintained and difficult to navigate. I chose to redesign the current website to improve UX and accessibility.

## UX

### User Story

X is living in cork with his wife and children and he's a practicing muslim. He uses the website mainly to check prayer time. As he has children, he's also interested to register them for weekend activities.

### Wireframe

Please see wireframe folder.

### UX/Design choice

As per the user story, the main expected reason for people to visit the website is to gather information about the prayer time. For this reason, prayer time is centered in index.html and timetable can be downloade from the footer.

## Technologies used

For this project, we used HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP. In order to have the navbar shrink, Javascript has been used (see credit below).


## Testing

This website has been tested on Chrome and Mozillia with laptop, Iphone and Android devices.

## Deployment 

The website has been deployed using GITHUB and can be access with the below link:

## Acknowledgment/Credit

The navbar and blockquote were used from bootstrap website.

The Gallery was used using the same content provided in the CodeInsitute course dedicated to gallery.

## Conclusion



Happy review!
