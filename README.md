Welcome to Nicolas Vandendriessche's User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project!

## Background 

The Cork local mosque website (http://www.corkmosque.com/admin/) is not maintained and difficult to navigate. I chose to redesign the current website to improve UX and accessibility.

## UX

### User Story

As a X is living in cork He uses the website mainly to check prayer time.

As a with his wife and children interested to register them for weekend activities.

As a practicing muslim submit ideas 

### Wireframe

Please see wireframe folder.

### UX/Design choice

As per the user story, the main expected reason for people to visit the website is to gather information about the prayer time. For this reason, prayer time is centered in index.html and timetable can be downloade from the footer.

## Technologies used

For this project, we used HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP. In order to have the navbar shrink, Javascript has been used (see credit below).


## Testing

This website has been tested on Chrome and Mozillia with laptop, Iphone and Android devices.

## Deployment 

The website has been deployed using github. EXPAND

This can be access with the below link:
