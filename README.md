## Acknowledgment/Credit

Content used from previous website, code from stackoverflow, bootstrap, ...

## Bugs

### Home:

Change current "Rissalah school, Prayer time and gallery" width to take more space in md and lg screens

Maybe add a section with text to prevent image overload

### Rissalah:

Improve layout and style of content Remove ul and ol Decoration

### Prayer:

Improve layout and style of Iqama section

Set max-height of picture (not too sure how to do it for SM and XL screens)

Keep Carousel or change layout to have previews only?

### Galery:

Add third section and iframe

### About us:

Maybe add presentation of people

### Contact Us:

Fixe line height "do you live in Cork? "


### Less important

Ensure footer line height is not an issue while in small resolution


## Conclusion



Happy review!
